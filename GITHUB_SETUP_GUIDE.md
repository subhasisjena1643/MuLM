# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Guide
## Step-by-Step Instructions to Upload µLM AI Playground

### 📋 Prerequisites
- Git installed on your system
- GitHub account with access to the repository
- Command line/terminal access

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Prepare Your Local Repository

### Open Terminal/Command Prompt
Navigate to your project directory:
```bash
cd d:\MuLM
```

### Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)
```bash
git init
```

### Configure Git (if first time)
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

---

## 🧹 Step 2: Clean and Organize the Codebase

### Remove unnecessary files
```bash
# Remove development artifacts
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf dist
rm -rf .vite

# Remove temporary files
rm -f *.log
rm -f debug.log
```

### Ensure .gitignore is working
```bash
# Check what files will be added
git status

# If you see files that shouldn't be tracked, update .gitignore
```

---

## 📦 Step 3: Stage Your Files

### Add all files to staging
```bash
git add .
```

### Check what's being staged
```bash
git status
```

### Create initial commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: µLM AI Playground v1.0

## 🔗 Step 4: Connect to GitHub Repository

### Add remote repository
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/subhasisjena1643/MuLM.git
```

### Verify remote is added
```bash
git remote -v
```

### Set main branch
```bash
git branch -M main
```

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Push to GitHub

### First push (with upstream tracking)
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### If you encounter authentication issues:

#### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Generate new token with `repo` permissions
3. Use token as password when prompted

#### Option B: SSH Key (Alternative)
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Add to SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Add public key to GitHub account
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy output and add to GitHub → Settings → SSH Keys

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:subhasisjena1643/MuLM.git
```

---

## 📝 Step 6: Verify Upload

### Check GitHub repository
1. Visit: https://github.com/subhasisjena1643/MuLM
2. Verify all files are uploaded
3. Check README.md is displaying correctly

### Verify important files are present:
- ✅ `README.md` (main project documentation)
- ✅ `package.json` (dependencies and scripts)
- ✅ `src/` folder (source code)
- ✅ `docs/` folder (documentation)
- ✅ `HACKATHON_PRESENTATION.md` (presentation content)
- ✅ `LICENSE` (MIT license)
- ✅ `.gitignore` (ignore file)

---

## 🏷️ Step 7: Add Repository Details (Optional but Recommended)

### Add repository description
Go to GitHub repository → Settings → add description:
```
Visual AI Workflow Builder - From Idea to Production in Minutes. Transform natural language into production-ready AI workflows with drag-and-drop interface.
```

### Add topics/tags
```
ai, workflow, visual-programming, react, typescript, hackathon, no-code, openai, machine-learning, developer-tools
```

### Create releases
```bash
# Tag current version
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "µLM AI Playground v1.0.0 - Hackathon Release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## 🔄 Step 8: Future Updates

### For subsequent changes:
```bash
# Make your changes
# ...

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add new feature or fix: bug description"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Branching strategy (recommended):
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Merge after review
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Authentication Failed
```bash
# Use Personal Access Token
# Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
# Generate token with repo permissions
# Use token as password
```

### Issue 2: Repository Already Exists
```bash
# If you need to overwrite
git push origin main --force

# Or rename your branch
git branch -m main backup
git checkout -b main
```

### Issue 3: Large File Errors
```bash
# Check file sizes
find . -size +100M -not -path "./node_modules/*"

# Use Git LFS for large files
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.tar.gz"
git add .gitattributes
```

### Issue 4: Line Ending Issues (Windows)
```bash
# Configure line endings
git config core.autocrlf true
```
