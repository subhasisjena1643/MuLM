## RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

### OpenAI API Efficiency ($50 budget)
```
Implement smart OpenAI usage for µLM:
- Cache generated experts locally to avoid regeneration
- Use GPT-3.5-turbo for most tasks, GPT-4 only for complex expert generation
- Template-based generation with parameter substitution
- Batch multiple requests when possible
- Implement request deduplication
- Use shorter, more efficient prompts
- Local fallback templates when API budget exhausted
- Progress tracking to monitor credit usage
- Graceful degradation when limits reached
```

### Infrastructure Optimization ($100 budget)
```
Design lightweight infrastructure for µLM:
- Use Redis only for caching, SQLite for persistence
- Implement lazy loading for expert models
- Use model quantization for memory efficiency
- Container image optimization (multi-stage Docker builds)
- Client-side simulation when possible
- Efficient asset bundling and compression
- CDN-friendly static asset organization
- Database query optimization
- Memory-mapped file access for large models
```
