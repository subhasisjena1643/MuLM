## 📊 Slide 1: The Problem - AI Development is Broken
### **85% of AI projects never make it to production**

**Who's Affected:**
- **Enterprises** waste $6.2B annually on failed AI initiatives
- **SMBs** can't afford $200K+ AI development costs  
- **Developers** spend 70% of time on boilerplate, not innovation
- **Data Scientists** struggle with production deployment complexity

**Key Pain Points:**
- 🔴 **Architecture Complexity**: Choosing the right AI models and frameworks
- 🔴 **Integration Hell**: Connecting different AI services and APIs
- 🔴 **Cost Uncertainty**: No visibility into compute and API costs
- 🔴 **Time to Market**: 6-12 months from prototype to production

*"We're solving the same problems that WordPress solved for web development"*
